# Welcome to compwhile documentation!

compwhile is an open source project to enhance and level up your study of programming languages in Computability Theory course.

The compwhile core library is wrapped inside a web application to create a powerful web IDE for editing and running computer programs written in WHILE and other languages presented in the book [Computability and Complexity from a Programming Perspective](http://www.diku.dk/~neil/Comp2book.html) (1997) by Neil Jones.

## Documents
Inside this repository you'll find:

 * **[requirements](01-requirements.md)** - the main document to describe the features of this
   project.
 * **[design](02-design.md)** - the main document to describe the high level design and
   architecutre of this project.
 * **meetings** - meeting notes.
 * **proposals** - documents that describe proposals for future features of compwhile.

## Releases
compwhile will follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 standard](http://semver.org).

We plan to deliver our first release, v0.1.0, by the end of June 2017.

## Want to contribute?
compwhile is written with extensibility in mind - the plugins system allows you to add support for new languages easily. Our goal is to support the following features in the future:

* Edit and run WHILE programs.
* Edit and run GOTO programs.
* Edit and run F/F+ programs.
* Debugger.
* Time complexity calculation.

### Integrations
* [compwhile on taiga.io](https://tree.taiga.io/project/elizehavi-compwhile) - Agile project management platform for compwhile.
* [compwhile on Slack](https://compwhile.slack.com) - Instant messaging platform with channels on: GitHub updates, taiga updates and project management.

### Project repositories
